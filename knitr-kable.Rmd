```{r}
library(tidyverse)
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/ais.txt"
athletes=read_tsv(my_url)
```

one that works

```{r}
athletes %>% select(Sex:WCC) %>% knitr::kable()
```

does this?

```{r}
athletes %>% sample_n(10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

here it does

```{r}
athletes %>% slice(c(10, 13, 17, 42)) %>% knitr::kable()
```
