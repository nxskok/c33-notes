## Summary

On a normal quantile plot:

- points following line (with some small wiggles): normal.
- kind of deviation from a straight line indicates kind of nonnormality:
  - a few highest point(s) too high and/or lowest too low: outliers
  - else see how points at each end off the line:
  
  \begin{tabular}{llcc}
  && \multicolumn{2}{c}{High points}\\
  && Too low & too high\\
  \hline
  Low points & Too low & Skewed left & Long tails\\
             & Too high & Short tails & Skewed right \\
  \hline
  
  \end{tabular}
