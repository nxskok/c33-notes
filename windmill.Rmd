## The windmill data
- Engineer: does amount of electricity generated by windmill depend on
how strongly wind blowing?
- Measurements of wind speed and DC current generated at various
times.
- Assume the “various times” to be randomly selected — aim to
generalize to “this windmill at all times”.
- Research questions:
  - Relationship between wind speed and current generated?
  - If so, what kind of relationship?
  - Can we model relationship to do predictions?
  
## Packages for this section

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```


## Reading in the data

```{r}
my_url <- 
  "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/windmill.csv"
windmill <- read_csv(my_url)
```

## The data


```{r}
windmill
```

## Strategy
- Two quantitative variables, looking for relationship: regression
methods.
- Start with picture (scatterplot).
- Fit models and do model checking, fixing up things as necessary.
- Scatterplot:
  - 2 variables, `DC_output` and `wind_velocity`.
  - First is output/response, other is input/explanatory.
  - Put `DC_output` on vertical scale.
- Add trend, but don’t want to assume linear:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_velocity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F) 
```

## Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_velocity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F) 
```

## Comments
- Definitely a relationship: as wind velocity increases, so does DC
output. (As you’d expect.)
- Is relationship linear? To help judge, `geom_smooth` smooths
scatterplot trend. (Trend called “loess”, “Locally weighted least
squares” which downweights outliers. Not constrained to be straight.)
- Trend more or less linear for while, then curves downwards (levelling off?). Straight
line not so good here.

## Fit a straight line (and see what happens)

```{r, echo=F}
wid <- getOption("width")
options(width=60)
```


\scriptsize
```{r}
DC.1 <- lm(DC_output ~ wind_velocity, data = windmill)
summary(DC.1)
```
\normalsize

```{r, echo=F}
options(width=wid)
```


## Another way of looking at the output

- The standard output tends to go off the bottom of the page rather easily. Package `broom` has these:

\scriptsize
```{r}
glance(DC.1)
```
\normalsize

showing that the R-squared is 87%, and

\footnotesize
```{r}
tidy(DC.1)
```
\normalsize

showing the intercept and slope and their significance.

## Comments
- Strategy: `lm` actually fits the regression. Store results in a variable.
Then look at the results, eg. via `summary` or `glance`/`tidy`. 
- My strategy for model names: base on response variable (or data frame name) and a number.
Allows me to fit several models to same data and keep track of which
is which.
- Results actually pretty good: `wind.velocity` strongly significant,
R-squared (87%) high.
- How to check whether regression is appropriate? Look at the
residuals, observed minus predicted, plotted against fitted (predicted).
- Plot using the regression object as “data frame” (see over).

## back to scatterplot, but this time add line

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_velocity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = F)
```

## The plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_velocity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = F)
```


## Plot of residuals against fitted values

```{r}
ggplot(DC.1, aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted)) + geom_point()
```

## Comments on residual plot
- Residual plot should be a random scatter of points.
- Should be no pattern “left over” after fitting the regression.
- Smooth trend should be more or less straight across at 0.
- Here, have a curved trend on residual plot.
- This means original relationship must have been a curve (as we saw
on original scatterplot).
- Possible ways to fit a curve:
  - Add a squared term in explanatory variable.
  - Transform response variable (doesn’t work well here).
  - See what science tells you about mathematical form of relationship,
and try to apply.

## Parabolas and fitting parabola model
- A parabola has equation
$$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$
with coefficients $a, b, c$. About the simplest function that is not a straight
line.
- Fit one using `lm` by adding $x^2$ to right side of model formula with +:
```{r}
DC.2 <- lm(DC_output ~ wind_velocity + I(wind_velocity^2),
  data = windmill
)
```

- The `I()` necessary because `^` in model formula otherwise means
something different (to do with interactions in ANOVA).
- This actually *multiple regression*.
- Call it *parabola model*.

## Parabola model output

```{r}
tidy(DC.2)
```

\scriptsize
```{r}
glance(DC.2)
```
\normalsize

## Comments on output


- R-squared has gone up a lot, from 87% (line) to 97% (parabola).
- Coefficient of squared term strongly significant (P-value $6.59 \times 10^{−8}$).
- Adding squared term has definitely improved fit of model.
- Parabola model better than linear one.
- But...need to check residuals again.

## Residual plot from parabola model

```{r}
ggplot(DC.2, aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Make scatterplot with fitted line and curve 

- Residual plot basically random. Good.
- Scatterplot with fitted line and curve like this:

```{r fitcurve, eval=F}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_velocity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  geom_line(data = DC.2, aes(y = .fitted))
```

## Comments

- This plots: 
  - scatterplot (`geom_point`); 
  - straight line (via tweak to
`geom_smooth`, which draws best-fitting line); 
  - fitted curve, using the
predicted `DC_output` values, joined by lines (with points not shown).
- Trick in the `geom_line` is use the predictions as the `y`-points to join
by lines (from `DC.2`), instead of the original data points. Without the
`data` and `aes` in the `geom_line`, original data points would be joined
by lines.

## Scatterplot with fitted line and curve

```{r, ref.label="fitcurve", echo=F}
```

Curve clearly fits better than line. 


## Another approach to a curve
- There is a problem with parabolas, which we’ll see later.
- Ask engineer,  “what should happen
as wind velocity increases?”:

    - Upper limit on electricity generated, but otherwise, the larger the
       wind velocity, the more electricity generated.

- Mathematically, *asymptote*. Straight lines and parabolas
don’t have them, but eg. $y = 1/x$ does: as $x$ gets bigger, $y$
approaches zero without reaching it.
- What happens to $y = a + b(1/x)$ as $x$ gets large?
  - $y$ gets closer and closer to $a$: that is, $a$ is asymptote.
- Fit this, call it asymptote model.
- Fitting the model here because we have math to justify it.
  - Alternative, $y = a + be^{−x}$ , approaches asymptote faster.

## How to fit asymptote model?
- Define new explanatory variable to be $1/x$,
and predict $y$ from it.
- $x$ is velocity, distance over time.
- So $1/x$ is time over distance. In walking world, if you walk 5 km/h,
take 12 minutes to walk 1 km, called your pace. So 1 over
`wind_velocity` we call `wind_pace`.
- Make a scatterplot first to check for straightness (next page).

```{r straightness, fig.keep="none"}
windmill %>% mutate(wind_pace = 1 / wind_velocity) -> windmill
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_pace)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F)
```

- and run regression like this (output page after):

```{r asyreg}
DC.3 <- lm(DC_output ~ wind_pace, data = windmill)
summary(DC.3)
```

## Scatterplot for wind_pace

Pretty straight. Blue actually smooth curve not line:

```{r, ref.label="straightness", echo=F}
ggplot(windmill, aes(y = DC_output, x = wind_pace)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F)
```




## Regression output

\scriptsize

```{r}
glance(DC.3)
```

\normalsize

```{r}
tidy(DC.3)
```

## Comments
- R-squared, 98%, even higher than for parabola model (97%).
- Simpler model, only one explanatory variable (`wind.pace`) vs. 2 for
parabola model (`wind.velocity` and its square).
- `wind.pace` (unsurprisingly) strongly significant.
- Looks good, but check residual plot (over). 


## Residual plot for asymptote model

```{r resida}
ggplot(DC.3, aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted)) + geom_point()
```


## Plotting trends on scatterplot
- Residual plot not bad. But residuals go up to 0.10 and down to
−0.20, suggesting possible skewness (not normal). I think it’s not
perfect, but OK overall.
- Next: plot scatterplot with all three fitted lines/curves on it (for
comparison), with legend saying which is which.
- First make data frame containing what we need, taken from the right
places:

```{r}
w2 <- tibble(
  wind_velocity = windmill$wind_velocity,
  DC_output = windmill$DC_output,
  linear = fitted(DC.1),
  parabola = fitted(DC.2),
  asymptote = fitted(DC.3)
)
```

## What’s in `w2`

```{r}
w2
```

## Making the plot
- `ggplot` likes to have one column of $x$’s to plot, and one column of
$y$’s, with another column for distinguishing things.
- But we have three columns of fitted values, that need to be combined
into one.
- `pivot_longer`, then plot:

```{r allcurves, eval=F}
w2 %>%
  pivot_longer(linear:asymptote, names_to="model", 
               values_to="fit") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wind_velocity, y = DC_output)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit, colour = model))
```

## Scatterplot with fitted curves

```{r, ref.label= "allcurves", echo=F}

```

## Comments
- Predictions from curves are very similar.
- Predictions from asymptote model as good, and from simpler model
(one $x$ not two), so prefer those.
- Go back to asymptote model summary.

## Asymptote model summary

```{r}
tidy(DC.3)
```

## Comments
- Intercept in this model about 3.
- Intercept of asymptote model is the asymptote (upper limit of
`DC.output`).
- Not close to asymptote yet.
- Therefore, from this model, wind could get stronger and would
generate appreciably more electricity.
- This is extrapolation! Would like more data from times when
`wind.velocity` higher.
- Slope −7. Why negative?
  - As wind.velocity increases,
  - wind.pace goes down,
  - and DC.output goes up. Check.
- Actual slope number hard to interpret.

## Checking back in with research questions
- Is there a relationship between wind speed and current generated?
  - Yes.
- If so, what kind of relationship is it?
  - One with an asymptote.
- Can we model the relationship, in such a way that we can do
predictions?
  - Yes, see model DC.3 and plot of fitted curve.
- Good. Job done.

## Job done, kinda
- Just because the parabola model and asymptote model agree over the
range of the data, doesn’t necessarily mean they agree everywhere.
- Extend range of wind.velocity to 1 to 16 (steps of 0.5), and
predict DC.output according to the two models:

```{r}
wv <- seq(1, 16, 0.5)
wv
```

- R has `predict`, which requires what to predict for, as data frame.
The data frame has to contain values, with matching names, for all
explanatory variables in regression(s).

## Setting up data frame to predict from

- Linear model had just `wind_velocity`.
- Parabola model had that as well (squared one will be calculated)
- Asymptote model had just `wind_pace` (reciprocal of velocity).
- So create data frame called `wv_new` with those in:

```{r}
wv_new <- tibble(wind_velocity = wv, wind_pace = 1 / wv)
```

## `wv_new`

```{r}
wv_new
```

## Doing predictions, one for each model
- Use same names as before:

```{r}
linear <- predict(DC.1, wv_new)
parabola <- predict(DC.2, wv_new)
asymptote <- predict(DC.3, wv_new)
```
- Put it all into a data frame for plotting, along with original data:

```{r}
my_fits <- tibble(
  wind_velocity = wv_new$wind_velocity,
  linear, parabola, asymptote
)
```

## `my_fits`



```{r}
my_fits
```


## Making a plot 1/2

- To make a plot, we use the same trick as last time to get all three
predictions on a plot with a legend (saving result to add to later):

```{r}
my_fits %>%
    pivot_longer(
    linear:asymptote,
    names_to="model", 
    values_to="fit"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    y = fit, x = wind_velocity,
    colour = model
  )) + geom_line() -> g
```

## Making a plot 2/2

- The observed wind velocities were in this range:
```{r}
(vels <- range(windmill$wind_velocity))
```

- `DC.output` between 0 and 3 from asymptote model. Add rectangle to
graph around where the data were:

```{r rectangle, eval=F}
g + geom_rect(
  xmin = vels[1], xmax = vels[2], ymin = 0, ymax = 3,
  alpha=0, colour = "black"
)
```

## The plot

```{r, ref.label="rectangle", echo=F}
```

## Comments (1)
- Over range of data, two models agree with each other well.
- Outside range of data, they disagree violently!
- For larger `wind.velocity`, asymptote model behaves reasonably,
parabola model does not.
- What happens as `wind.velocity` goes to zero? Should find
`DC.output` goes to zero as well. Does it?

## Comments (2)

- For parabola model:

```{r}
tidy(DC.2)
```

- Nope, goes to −1.16 (intercept), actually significantly different from
zero.

## Comments (3): asymptote model

\small
```{r}
tidy(DC.3)
```
\normalsize

- As `wind.velocity` heads to 0, wind.pace heads to $+\infty$, so
DC.output heads to $−\infty$! 
- Also need more data for small `wind.velocity` to understand
relationship. (Is there a lower asymptote?)
- Best we can do now is to predict `DC.output` to be zero for small
`wind.velocity`.
- Assumes a “threshold” wind velocity below which no electricity
generated at all.

## Summary
- Often, in data analysis, there is no completely satisfactory conclusion,
as here.
- Have to settle for model that works OK, with restrictions.
- Always something else you can try.
- At some point you have to say “I stop.”
