## Tidying data
- Data rarely come to us as we want to use them.
- Before we can do analysis, typically have organizing to do.
- This is typical of ANOVA-type data, “wide format”: 

```
pig feed1 feed2 feed3 feed4
  1  60.8  68.7  92.6  87.9
  2  57.0  67.7  92.1  84.2
  3  65.0  74.0  90.2  83.1
  4  58.6  66.3  96.5  85.7
  5  61.7  69.8  99.1  90.3
```

- 20 pigs are randomly allocated to one of four feeds. At the end of the
study, the weight of each pig is recorded, and we want to know
whether there are any differences in mean weights among the feeds.
- Problem: want the weights all in one column, with 2nd column
labelling which feed each weight was from. Untidy!


## Tidy and untidy data (Wickham) 
- Data set easier to deal with if:
  - each observation is one row
  - each variable is one column
  - each type of observation unit is one table
- Data arranged this way called “tidy”; otherwise called “untidy”.
- For the pig data:
  - response variable is weight, but scattered over 4
columns, which are levels of a factor `feed`.
  - Want all the weights in one column, with a second column `feed`
saying which feed that weight goes with.
  - Then we can run `aov`.
  
## Packages for this section

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

  
## Reading in the pig data

```{r, message=F}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/pigs1.txt"
pigs1 <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
pigs1
```

## Gathering up the columns (OLD)
- This is a very common reorganization, and the magic “verb” is
`gather`:
```{r}
pigs1 %>% gather(feed, weight, feed1:feed4) -> pigs2
```

- `pigs2` is now in “long” format, ready for analysis. See next page.
- Anatomy of `gather`: what makes the columns different (different
feeds), what makes them the same (all weights), which columns to
combine.

## Long format pigs

```{r}
pigs2
```

## Another way to do this: (NEW)

```{r}
pigs1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(feed1:feed4, names_to = "feed", 
               values_to="weight") -> pigs2
pigs2
```


## ...and finally, the analysis
- which is just what we saw before:
```{r}
weight.1 <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = pigs2)
summary(weight.1)
```

- The mean weights of pigs on the different feeds are definitely not all
equal.
- So we run Tukey to see which ones differ (over).

## Tukey

```{r}
TukeyHSD(weight.1)
```

All of the feeds differ! 

## Mean weights by feed 

To find the best and worst, get mean weight by 
feed group. I borrowed an idea from later to put the means in descending order:

```{r}
pigs2 %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

Feed 3 is best, feed 1 worst.

## Should we have any concerns about the ANOVA?

Feed 2 has an outlier, but there are only 5 pigs in each group, and the
conclusion is so clear that I am OK with this.

```{r, fig.height=3.2}
ggplot(pigs2, aes(x = feed, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```



## Tuberculosis

- The World Health Organization keeps track of number of cases of
various diseases, eg. tuberculosis.
- Some data:

```{r}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/tb.csv"
tb <- read_csv(my_url)
```

- Variables (see over): country (abbreviated), year. Then number of
cases for each gender and age group, eg. `m1524` is males aged 15–24.
Also `mu` and `fu`, where age is unknown.
- Lots of missings. Want to get rid of.

## The data

```{r}
tb
```

## Gather the gender-age group columns

OLD
```{r}
tb %>% gather(genage, freq, m04:fu, na.rm = T) -> tb2
```

or

NEW

```{r}
tb %>% 
  pivot_longer(m04:fu, names_to = "genage", 
               values_to = "freq", values_drop_na = T) -> tb2
```

- columns to make longer
- column to contain the names
- column to contain the values
- (optional) drop missings in the values

## Results (some)

```{r}
tb2
```

## Separating
- 4 columns, but 5 variables, since `genage` contains both gender and
age group. Split that up using separate.
- `separate` needs 3 things:
  - what to separate (no quotes needed),
  - what to separate into (here you do need quotes),
  - how to split.
- For “how to split”, here “after first character”:
```{r}
tb2 %>% separate(genage, c("gender", "age"), 1) -> tb3
```

## Tidied tuberculosis data (some)

```{r}
tb3
```

## In practice...

- instead of doing the pipe one step at a time, you *debug* it one step at
a time, and when you have each step working, you use that step’s
output as input to the next step, thus:
```{r}
tb %>%
  pivot_longer(m04:fu, names_to = "genage", 
               values_to = "freq", values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  separate(genage, c("gender", "age"), 1) -> tb3
```

- You can split the R code over as many lines as you like, as long as
each line is incomplete, so that R knows more is to come.
- I like to put the pipe symbol on the end of the line.

## Total tuberculosis cases by year (some of the years) 

```{r}
tb3 %>%
  filter(between(year, 1991, 1998)) %>% 
  count(year, wt=freq) 
```

- Something very interesting happened between 1994 and 1995.

## To find out what

- try counting up total cases by country:

```{r}
tb3 %>% 
  count(iso2, wt=freq) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## what years do I have for China?

China started recording in 1995, which is at least part of the problem:

```{r}
tb3 %>% filter(iso2=="CN") %>% 
  count(year, wt=freq)
```

## first year of recording for each country?

- A lot of countries started recording in about 1995:

```{r}
tb3 %>% group_by(iso2) %>% 
  summarize(first_year=min(year)) %>% 
  arrange(first_year)
```


## Some Toronto weather data

```{r}
my_url <- 
  "http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/toronto_weather.csv"
weather <- read_csv(my_url)
```

## The data (some)

```{r}
weather
```

## The columns

- Daily weather records for "Toronto City" weather station in 2018:

  - *station*: identifier for this weather station (always same here)
  - *Year*, *Month*: obvious 
  - *element*: whether temperature given was daily max or daily min
  - *d01, d02*,... *d31*: day of the month from 1st to 31st.

- Numbers in data frame all temperatures (for different days of the month),
so first step is

```{r}
weather %>% 
  pivot_longer(d01:d31, names_to="day", 
               values_to="temperature", 
               values_drop_na = T) -> d
```

## So far

```{r}
d
```

## The days
- Column `element` contains names of two different variables, that
should each be in separate column.
- Distinct from eg. `m1524` in tuberculosis data, that contained levels of
two different factors, handled by separate.
- Untangling names of variables handled by `pivot_wider`:

```{r}
weather %>%
  pivot_longer(d01:d31, names_to="day", 
               values_to="temperature", 
               values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=element, 
                values_from=temperature) -> d
```

## So far

```{r}
d
```

## Further improvements
- We have tidy data now, but can improve things further.
- `mutate` creates new columns from old (or assign back to change a
variable).
- Would like numerical dates. `separate` works, or pull out number as
below.
- `select` keeps columns (or drops, with minus). Station name has no
value to us:

\small
```{r}
weather %>%
  pivot_longer(d01:d31, names_to="day", 
               values_to="temperature", values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=element, values_from=temperature) %>% 
  mutate(Day = parse_number(day)) %>%
  select(-station) -> d
```
\normalsize
## So far

```{r}
d
```

## Final step(s)
- Make year-month-day into proper date.
- Keep only date, tmax, tmin:
\small
```{r}
weather %>%
  pivot_longer(d01:d31, names_to="day", 
               values_to="temperature", values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=element, values_from=temperature) %>% 
  mutate(Day = parse_number(day)) %>%
  select(-station) %>% 
  unite(datestr, c(Year, Month, Day), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(datestr)) %>%
  select(c(date, tmax, tmin)) -> weather_tidy
```
\normalsize

## Our tidy data frame

```{r}
weather_tidy
```

## Plotting the temperatures
- Plot temperature against date joined by lines, but with separate lines
for max and min. `ggplot` requires something like

\footnotesize
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(..., aes(x = date, y = temperature)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```
\normalsize

only we have two temperatures, one a max and one a min, that we
want to keep separate.

- The trick: combine `tmax` and `tmin` together into one column, keeping
track of what kind of temp they are. (This actually same format as
untidy `weather`.) Are making `weather_tidy`
untidy for purposes of drawing graph only.
- Then can do something like

\footnotesize
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(d, aes(x = date, y = temperature, colour = maxmin)) 
  + geom_point() + geom_line()
```
\normalsize
to distinguish max and min on graph.

## Setting up plot
- Since we only need data frame for plot, we can do the
column-creation and plot in a pipeline.
- For a `ggplot` in a pipeline, the initial data frame is omitted, because it
is whatever came out of the previous step.
- To make those “one column”s: `pivot_longer`. I save the graph to show overleaf:
```{r}
weather_tidy %>%
  pivot_longer(tmax:tmin, names_to="maxmin", 
               values_to="temperature") %>%
  mutate(temperature = as.numeric(temperature)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = temperature, colour = maxmin)) +
  geom_line() -> g
```

## The plot

```{r, fig.height=3.9}
g
```

## Doing things with data frames
Let’s go back to our Australian athletes: 

```{r read-athletes, echo=F}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/ais.txt"
athletes=read_tsv(my_url)
```

\footnotesize

```{r}
athletes
```
\normalsize

## Choosing a column

```{r}
athletes %>% select(Sport)
```

## Choosing several columns

```{r}
athletes %>% select(Sport, Hg, BMI)
```

## Choosing consecutive columns

```{r}
athletes %>% select(Sex:WCC)
```

## Choosing all-but some columns

```{r}
athletes %>% select(-(RCC:LBM))
```

## Select-helpers
Other ways to select columns: 

- `starts_with` something
- `ends_with` something
- `contains` something
- `matches` a “regular expression”
- `num_range` like x1 to x3
- `everything()` all the columns

## Columns whose names begin with S 

```{r}
athletes %>% select(starts_with("S"))
```

## Columns whose names end with C

either uppercase or lowercase:

```{r}
athletes %>% select(ends_with("c"))
```

## Column names containing letter R

```{r}
athletes %>% select(contains("r"))
```

## Exactly two characters, ending with T

In regular expression terms, this is `^.t$`:

- `^` means “start of text”
- `.` means “exactly one character, but could be anything”
- `$` means “end of text”.
```{r}
athletes %>% select(matches("^.t$"))
```

## Displaying some numbered columns

Make up a data frame to illustrate. This `sample` generates 5 random values
equally likely to be anything 0–9 (without replacement): 

```{r}
(d <- tibble(
  y = sample(0:9, 5),
  x1 = sample(0:9, 5),
  x2 = sample(0:9, 5),
  x3 = sample(0:9, 5)
))
```

## Just display x2 and x3:
```{r}
d %>% select(num_range("x", 2:3))
```

## Choosing rows by number 

```{r, paged.print=F}
athletes %>% slice(16:25)
```

## Non-consecutive rows 

```{r, paged.print=F}
athletes %>% slice(c(10, 13, 17, 42))
```

## A random sample of rows

```{r, paged.print=F}
athletes %>% sample_n(8)
```

## Rows for which something is true

\footnotesize
```{r}
athletes %>% filter(Sport == "Tennis")
```
\normalsize

## More complicated selections

```{r}
athletes %>% filter(Sport == "Tennis", RCC < 5)
```

## Either/Or

```{r}
athletes %>% filter(Sport == "Tennis" | RCC > 5)
```

## Sorting into order

```{r}
athletes %>% arrange(RCC)
```

## Breaking ties by another variable

```{r}
athletes %>% arrange(RCC, BMI)
```

## Descending order

```{r}
athletes %>% arrange(desc(BMI))
```

## “The top ones”


```{r}
athletes %>%
  arrange(desc(Wt)) %>%
  slice(1:7) %>%
  select(Sport, Wt)
```

## Create new variables from old ones

```{r new-from-old}
athletes %>%
  mutate(wt_lb = Wt * 2.2) %>%
  select(Sport, Wt, wt_lb)
```

## Turning the result into a number
Output is always data frame unless you explicitly turn it into something
else, eg. the weight of the heaviest athlete, as a number:

```{r to-number}
athletes %>% arrange(desc(Wt)) %>% pluck("Wt", 1)
```

Or the 20 heaviest weights in descending order:


```{r}
athletes %>%
  arrange(desc(Wt)) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>%
  pluck("Wt")
```

## Another way to do the last one

```{r}
athletes %>%
  arrange(desc(Wt)) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>%
  pull("Wt")
```

`pull` grabs the column you name *as a vector* (of whatever it contains).

## To find the mean height of the women athletes
Two ways:

\small
```{r}
athletes %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarize(m = mean(Ht))
```

```{r}
athletes %>%
  filter(Sex == "female") %>%
  summarize(m = mean(Ht))
```

\normalsize

## Summary of data selection/arrangement "verbs"

 \begin{tabular}{lp{0.7\textwidth}}
    Verb & Purpose\\
    \hline
    \texttt{select} & Choose columns\\
    \texttt{print} & Display non-default \# of rows/columns \\
    \texttt{slice} & Choose rows by number\\
    \texttt{sample\_n} & Choose random rows\\ 
    \texttt{filter} & Choose rows satisfying conditions \\
    \texttt{arrange}& Sort in order by column(s) \\
    \texttt{mutate} & Create new variables\\
    \texttt{group\_by} & Create groups to summarize by\\
    \texttt{summarize} & Calculate summary statistics (by groups if defined)\\
    \texttt{pluck} & Extract items from data frame\\
    \texttt{pull} & Extract a single column from a data frame as a vector\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  
  
## Looking things up in another data frame
Recall the tuberculosis data set, tidied: 
```{r}
tb3
```

What are actual names of those countries in `iso2`?

## Actual country names
Found actual country names to go with those abbreviations, in spreadsheet: 

\footnotesize
```{r}
my_url <- 
  "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/ISOCountryCodes081507.xlsx"
```

\normalsize

```{r country-codes}
f <- tempfile()
download.file(my_url, f)
country_names <- read_excel(f)
```

## The country names

```{r}
country_names
```

## Looking up country codes
Matching a variable in one data frame to one in another is called a **join**
(database terminology):

```{r}
tb3 %>% left_join(country_names, by = c("iso2" = "Code_UC"))
```

## Total cases by country


```{r}
tb3 %>%
  group_by(iso2) %>%
  summarize(cases = sum(freq)) %>%
  left_join(country_names, by = c("iso2" = "Code_UC")) %>%
  select(Country, cases)
```

## or even sorted in order

```{r}
tb3 %>%
  group_by(iso2) %>%
  summarize(cases = sum(freq)) %>%
  left_join(country_names, by = c("iso2" = "Code_UC")) %>%
  select(Country, cases) %>%
  arrange(desc(cases))
```

## Comments

- This is probably not quite right because of:
  - the 1994-1995 thing
  - there is at least one country in `tb3` that was not in `country_names` (the NA above). Which?
  
\footnotesize  
```{r}
tb3 %>%
  anti_join(country_names, by = c("iso2" = "Code_UC")) %>%
  distinct(iso2)
```
