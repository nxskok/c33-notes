\begin{frame}{In this course}
\protect\hypertarget{in-this-course}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data analysis: use mostly known (to you) statistical methods to gain
  insight about data.
\item
  Use two software packages, SAS and R --- I assume you know nothing
  about these.
\item
  Look at lots of examples.
\item
  ``Get your hands dirty''.
\item
  Writing reports.
\item
  Other tasks in R and SAS.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prerequisites}
\protect\hypertarget{prerequisites}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You \emph{need} a second Statistics course that covers statistical
  inference from a mathematical viewpoint, one of these:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    STAB57
  \item
    STA 248
  \item
    STA 261
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I check prerequisites.
\item
  You need STAB57 for the Statistics Minor/Major/Specialist programs.
\end{itemize}

  course among your courses. Assignment hand-in, grading and marks will
  be done through Quercus.

\begin{frame}{Laptop use}
\protect\hypertarget{laptop-use}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you have a laptop, you may find it useful for following along with
  the use of the software or for taking notes.
\item
  Checking social media or other non-course-specific activity during
  class distracts from your learning. If you are going to get the most
  from this course, you need to pay full attention in class.
  Multi-tasking will not help you.
\item
  Using your laptop for non-course activity will also distract those
  around you and creates a worse learning experience for everybody. If
  somebody's inappropriate laptop use is distracting you, let me know. I
  will create laptop-free zones in class if necessary.
